# Vaccination Management System

The Vaccination Management System is a comprehensive command-line application designed to streamline the management of children's vaccination schedules. The system provides parents with an easy-to-use platform to keep track of important health milestones, ensuring that their children receive the necessary vaccinations on time.

## Mission and Purpose

### Mission

Our mission is to empower parents with a reliable and efficient tool to manage their children's vaccination schedules. By providing timely reminders and organized records, we aim to reduce the risk of missed vaccinations and ensure that children are protected against preventable diseases.

### Purpose

The Vaccination Management System was developed with the following purposes in mind:

- **Automated Record Keeping:** To simplify the process of tracking vaccination schedules, thereby reducing the administrative burden on parents.
- **Timely Reminders:** To provide parents with timely notifications about upcoming vaccinations, ensuring that children receive all necessary immunizations.
- **Health Facility Integration:** To offer a streamlined way to book vaccination appointments at nearby healthcare facilities, saving time and effort.
- **Growth Monitoring:** To allow parents to track their children's growth metrics, such as height and weight, alongside their vaccination records.

## Features

- **Add Child:** Register a child with a unique ID and their date of birth.
- **Book Vaccination Appointment:** Schedule a vaccination appointment based on the child's age, select a healthcare facility, and ensure the appointment date is in the future.
- **View Updates:** Check the child’s appointment history and growth records.
- **View Reminders:** Get reminders for upcoming appointments or vaccines that are due soon.
- **Add Growth Record:** Track the child’s height and weight.
- **Exit:** Safely exit the application.

## Healthcare Facilities

The system supports booking appointments at the following healthcare locations:

1. **Healthcare 1:** Mahipalpur
2. **Healthcare 2:** Gurudwara Bangla Sahib
3. **Healthcare 3:** Rajiv Chowk
4. **Healthcare 4:** Lal Quila
5. **Healthcare 5:** Lajpat Nagar
6. **Healthcare 6:** Faridabad
7. **Healthcare 7:** Rohini
8. **Healthcare 8:** Cannaught Place

## Technologies and Technical Details

### Programming Language

- **Python 3.x:** The core programming language used to develop the Vaccination Management System. Python was chosen for its simplicity, readability, and extensive standard library, which made it an ideal choice for this application.

### Modules and Libraries

- **`datetime`:** This module is used to manage date and time-related functionalities within the system, such as calculating the age of a child and scheduling appointments.
- **`random`:** Used for generating unique 4-digit user IDs for each child registered in the system. The randomness ensures that each ID is unique and prevents any duplication.

### Data Structures

- **Dictionaries:** The system uses dictionaries to store and manage records for each child. Each child’s data is stored under a unique key (User ID), and their information, such as name, date of birth, appointments, and growth records, is stored as key-value pairs within the dictionary.

### Error Handling

- **Input Validation:** The system includes input validation to ensure that the user’s choices are within valid ranges, and appointment dates cannot be set in the past.
- **Future Improvements:** Known issues, such as errors in Option 4 (View Reminders), are acknowledged, and fixes will be implemented in future updates.

### Scalability

The system is designed to handle multiple records efficiently, making it scalable for use by families with several children. As it is built using Python, it can be further expanded or integrated with more advanced features, such as GUI or mobile app integration, if needed.

## Usage

To use this system:

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the `vaccination_system.py` file using a Python interpreter.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the options.
